      Making sentences helps us put everything we have learned into action: so
      you have learned a new word and you understand when to use it. But for the
      brain to remember this word in the future, the best way to memorize is by
      using it.

      Make ten sentences that use different meanings of the word you want to
      learn or, if it is a verb, with different tenses. For example, if you want
      to remember the phrasal verb “to tidy up”, write: “Maria, you must tidy
      your room up”, “I have to tidy up before my friends come”, “Paul will
      watch TV after he finishes tidying up the kitchen”. */}
